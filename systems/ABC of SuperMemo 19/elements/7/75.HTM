SuperMemo will often ask you to fill the missing part of a sentence. For example:</P>
<P align=center><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> <STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff size=5>is the key weapon against forgetting</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P class="hint note"><STRONG>Hint</STRONG>: Try to recall the key weapon against forgetting. What word should replace the three dots?
