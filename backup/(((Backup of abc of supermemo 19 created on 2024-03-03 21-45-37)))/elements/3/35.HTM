<h3>Remember!</h3>
<p>If you see a piece of information that you do not want to remember, or you are sure that you will remember anyway (i.e. without SuperMemo), press <em>Ctrl+D</em></p>
<p align="center"><font size=5>Press <em>Ctrl+D</em> now to never see this page again while making repetitions</font></p>
<p class="hint note"><strong>Hint</strong>: You do not have to worry that you will forget the <em>Ctrl+D</em> shortcut because of pressing <em>Ctrl+D</em> now. You have already memorized a similar page (earlier in this course)</p>
