<p>You can convert fragments of articles to questions and answers. You will do it using the tool called <strong>Cloze</strong>. A cloze is a sentence with a word missing and replaced with three dots. Such a sentence can be understood as a question. Your job is to recall the missing part of the sentence.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><strong>Sentence:</strong></p>
<blockquote><em>The theory of relativity was proposed by Einstein.</em></blockquote>

<p><strong>Cloze:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>
	<strong>Question</strong>: <em>The theory of relativity was proposed by</em> <font class=cloze>[...]</font><br>
	<strong>Answer</strong>: <em>Einstein</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
